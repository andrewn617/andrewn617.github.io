Hi! I'm Andrew. I am software developer living in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. I'm a self taught developer who began learning to code in 2017. Currently I work on the Rails Infrastructure Team at Shopify, where we focus on improving Rails and our usage of it at Shopify.

Earlier in life I did a degree in Philosophy at University of Toronto. My interests are broad but I am most at home with Early Modern and Analytic philosophy. I still read a lot of Philosophy and I hope to continue my education in some form after my career as a developer is over (hopefully not any time soon!).

I had a quite a few jobs before becoming a software developer, including teaching oversees and working on the assembly line making cars. While learning to code, I worked in SaaS customer support and as a consultant doing software implementations, before getting my first job as a developer.

Besides programming, my main hobbies are playing piano and cooking. I also read a lot and widely.
